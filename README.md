# Suite of Personal Information Management Tools


This repository will contain a bunch of personal Information management tools I am developing for personal use. 
If you, or someone else finds use out of these tools as well, I have licensed it under the GPLv2, so enjoy!

The first tool is a Gamified Todo List application I have been procrastinating about creating for over a year. 
The funny part, is that I basically built it in only 3 hours.  That's a great example of the power of 
procrastinating is.  My entire Todo list used to be contained in a Gnumeric Spreadsheet, with a few calculated 
fields.  This desktop application basically does the same thing, but in a nice self-contained application.

All the tools in this repository will be created using FreePascal with the Lazarus Component Library.  Building on 
any supported platform is fairly easy.  If you have Lazarus installed already, just open up the project and 
compile.  You can also build it using the `lazbuild` command-line tool:

`lazbuild --build-mode=Release todoapp.lpr`

I do not plan at this point to publish compiled versions of any of these tools in this repository, if you want
to use them, you will need to compile it yourself on your platform of choice.  These tools are not meant for
end-users or end-consumers at the end of the day.  These are created to solely benefit my personal life, and
if you or someone you know also benefits, then that's awesome.  Source code is meant to be shared.
