# Future ideas and plans

### Pop-out window of family statistics
This will be useful for embedding the statistics of a family
currently being played directly onto a Twitch stream or screen
recording using OBS's "Capture Single Window" feature.

Status will include:
  - The Current generation of the household
    - Optionally display the rotation, if it's a rotation game.
  - The real-world date a household was born
    - Note if household is of a first-generation aka make in CAS.
    - Could potentially calculate how old a household is in real-world day.
    - Could also keep track of exact real-world playtime via an app timer.
  - Family bank of last update in SimsDB
    - Nice for keeping track of what a balance was before and after a play session.
  - Where the lot is located in-game
    - Such as World, Neighbourhood, etc...
  - List of current Sims in the household, as of last update Database update.
    - Could potentially show a photo of the Sim
    - The Sims name(nice for people jumping into a stream to know who's who)
    - The Current Life Stage of that Sim
    - Potentially other statistics

### Keep track of entire generations
This will be a system to keep track of a generational tree.  Such as noting the
top of the tree as a household being created in CAS, and all the generations
branching.  From a UI, it will be a button on a Sim profile page which will labeled
"View Parent", which will show the Sim's parent within the Database.  This process
can be continued until the user reaches the ultimate parent.

The hope is that these trees could then be exported as a single package, which can then
be shared with friends and other players.

### Storytelling features
The ability to write stories within the program is also a good key feature for
storytelling.  Such stories should also be exportable to a text file in different
templates, potentially even HTML.

Elements which should contain collections of stories should be:
  - Individual Sims
  - Households
  - Neighbourhoods
