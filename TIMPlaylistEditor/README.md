# TiMidity Playlist Editor

I made this so that I don't need to use a hex editor to remove the first null
character in these odd playlist files when I want to manually open and edit
them.  Not really of any use to anybody but myself, but if you use TiMidity
and wanted to edit those text-based playlist files, then here ya go!
