# Adventure Game Toolkit Help Browser

This was a text adventure game toolkit I used in my late teen years, which I was really fond of.
It is now available for free to download for most platforms at the website below.

I only recently found out that this adventure game toolkit was actually developed using the Pascal
language.

The application here allows you to browse the long text document in a stand-alone program with a nice
set of bookmarks to important parts of the documentation.

Not sure this will be useful to anybody but me, but if it is, you're welcome I guess.
